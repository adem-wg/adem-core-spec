Abstract

   In times of armed conflict, the protective emblems of the red cross,
   red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark physical assets.  This
   enables military units to identify assets as respected and protected
   under international humanitarian law.  This draft specifies the
   format and trust architecture of a protective, digital emblem to
   network-connected infrastructure.  Such emblems mark bearers as
   protected under IHL analogously to the physical emblems.

1.  Introduction

   International Humanitarian Law (IHL) mandates that military units
   must not attack medical facilities, such as hospitals.  The emblems
   of the red cross, red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark
   physical infrastructure (e.g., by a red cross painted on a hospital's
   rooftop), thereby enabling military units to identify those bearers
   as protected under IHL.  This document specifies the structure and
   trust model of digital emblems for IHL that can be used to mark
   digital infrastructure as protected under IHL analogously to the
   physical emblems.  We call this system _ADEM_, which stands for an
   Authentic Digital EMblem.

   In ADEM, emblems are signed statements that mark a _bearer_ as
   proteced under IHL.  Emblems are issued by _emblem issuers_. Emblem
   issuer can be authorized by _authorities_. Authorities do so by
   signing _endorsements_ for emblem issuers.  We call both emblems and
   endorsements _tokens_. Emblems are consumed and validated by
   _validators_.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *Token* A token is either an emblem or an endorsement and encoded as
   a JWS.

   *Emblem* An emblem is a sign of protection under IHL.

   *Endorsement* An endorsement associates a public key with an
   identity, and hence, resembles the idea of a certificate.  When
   signed by an authority, it attests that the authorized issuer can
   generally issue claims of protection.

   *Root Key* Organizations control root keys, which identify them
   cryptographically.  Any key of an organization that is endorsed by
   other parties is a root key.

   *Bearer* A bearer is a network-connected asset that enjoys the
   specific protections under IHL.  Bearers must be unambiguously
   identifiable and unambiguously protected, for example, if they are
   identified by a domain name that domain name must not be used for
   services that do not enjoy specific protections under IHL.

   *Emblem issuer* An emblem issuer is an organization entitled to issue
   claims of protection for their digital infrastructure.

   *Authority* An authority is an organization that is trusted by some
   to attest a party's status as protected.  This trust may stem from
   law.  For example, nation states or NGOs can take the role of
   authorities.

   *Organization* An emblem issuer or autority.

   *Validator* A validator is an agent interested in observing and
   verifying digital emblems.

   Beyond these terms, we use the terms "claim" and "header parameter"
   as references to the JWT specification [RFC7519].

3.  Tokens

3.1.  Identifiers and their Semantics

   Emblems are issued for bearers by emblem issuers, which in turn are
   authorized by authorities.  Both emblem issuers and authorities are
   _organizations_. This section specifies how bearers and organizations
   are identified.

3.1.1.  Bearer Identifiers

   Bearers are identified by _bearer identifiers_ (BIs).  Bearer
   identifiers closely resemble Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as
   specified in [RFC3986].  However, to limit their scope, we do not
   follow the specification of URIs and instead define our own syntax.

3.1.1.1.  Syntax

   Bearer identifiers follow the syntax (domain-name, IPv6 defined
   below):

   bearer-identifier = domain-name | "[" IPv6 "]"

   Domain names (domain-name) MUST be formatted as usual and specified
   in [RFC1035] with the exception that the leftmost label MAY be the
   single-character wildcard "*".  In particular, "*" itself is a valid
   domain name in context of this specification.

   IPv6 addresses (IPv6) MUST be formatted following [RFC4291].  IPv6
   addresses MUST be global unicast or link-local unicast addresses.
   Note that the syntax of IPv6 addresses also support IPv4 addresses
   through "IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Addresses" (cf. [RFC4291], Section 2.5.5.2
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4291.html#section-2.5.5.2)).

   These are examples of BIs:

   *  *.example.com

   *  [2001:0db8::248:1893:25c8:1946]

   *  [::FFFF:93.184.216.34]

3.1.1.2.  Semantics

   Several kinds of bearers can be identified by bearer identifiers:

   *  Network facing processes, e.g., web servers

   *  Computational devices both in the virtual sense, e.g., a virtual
      machine, and in the physical sense, e.g., a laptop

   *  Networks

   A BI identifies a set of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses:

   *  If the BI is an IPv6 address, it identifies this address only.

   *  If the BI an IPv6 address prefix, it identifies all IPv6 addresses
      matching that prefix.

   *  If the BI is a domain name, it identifies any address for which
      there is an A or AAAA record for that domain name.

   *  If the BI is a domain name starting with the wildcard "*", it
      identifies any address for which there is an A or AAAA record for
      that domain name or any of its subdomains.

   Any process reachable under any of the addresses pointed towards by
   address and on the port specified (or any port, if unspecified) is
   pointed by the respective BI.

3.1.1.3.  Order

   BIs may not only be used for identification but also for constraint
   purposes.  For example, an endorsement may constrain emblems to only
   signal protection for a specific IP address range.  In this section,
   we define an order on BIs so that one can verify if an identifying BI
   complies with a constraining BI.

   We define an BI A to be _more general_ than an BI B, if all of the
   following conditions apply:

   *  If A encodes a domain name and does not contain the wildcard "*",
      B encodes a domain name, too, and A is equal to B.

   *  If A encodes a domain name and contains the wildcard "*", B
      encodes a domain name, too, and B is a subdomain of A excluding
      the wildcard "*".  In this regard, any domain is considered a
      subdomain of itself.

   *  If A encodes an IP address, B encodes an IP address, too, and A is
      a prefix of B.

   Note that BIs encoding a domain name are incomparable to BIs encoding
   IP addresses, i.e., neither can be more general than the other.

3.1.2.  Organization Identifiers

   Emblems can be associated to an organization.  Organizations are
   identified by URIs, bearing the scheme "https" and a domain name.  We
   call URIs identifying organizations _organization identifiers_ (OIs).

   More precisely, an OI has the syntax:

   organization-identifier = "https://" domain-name

   Domain names must be formatted as usual, specified in [RFC1035], but
   always represented in all lower-case.  For example,
   https://example.com is a valid OI, but https://EXAMPLE.COM is not.

3.2.  Token Encoding

   Tokens MUST be encoded as a JWS [RFC7515] or as an unsecured JWT as
   defined in [RFC7519], Section 6
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-6) in compact
   serialization.  Tokens encoded as JWS MUST only use JWS protected
   headers and MUST include the jwk or the kid header parameter.  Any
   token MUST include the cty (content type) header parameter.

3.2.1.  Emblems

   An emblem is encoded either as JWS or as an unsecured JWT which
   signals protection of bearers.  It is distinguished by the cty header
   parameter value which MUST be "adem-emb".  Its payload includes the
   JWT claims defined in the table below, following [RFC7519],
   Section 4.1 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-
   4.1).  All other registered JWT claims MUST NOT be included.

                                  Table 1

   Multiple BIs within bearers may be desirable, e.g., to include both a
   bearer's IPv4 and IPv6 address.  The claim value of emb MUST be a
   JSON [RFC8259] object with the following key-value mappings.

   +=======+==========+=======================+========================+

                                  Table 2

     purpose = "protective" | "indicative"

     distribution-method = "dns" | "icmp" | "udp"

3.2.1.1.  Example

   For example, an emblem might comprise the following header and
   payload.

   Header:

   {
     "alg": "ES512",
     "kid": "4WICC9pZ5zh6m3sfNYwwLilHzNazbFoJU6Qe5ds_8pY",
     "cty": "adem-emb"
   }

   Payload:

   {
     "emb": {
       "dst": ["icmp"],
       "prp": ["protective"]
     },
     "iat": 1672916137,
     "nbf": 1672916137,
     "exp": 1675590932,
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "bearers": ["[2001:0db8:582:ae33::29]"]
   }

3.2.2.  Endorsements

   Endorsements are encoded as JWSs.  Endorsements attest two
   statements: that a public key is affiliated with an organization,
   pointed to by OIs, and that this organization is eligible to issue
   emblems for their bearers.  They are distinguished by the cty header
   parameter value which MUST be "adem-end".  An endorsement's payload
   includes the JWT claims defined in the table below.  All otger
   registered JWT claims MUST NOT be included.

    +-------+-------------+--------------------+----------------------+

                                  Table 3

   If an endorsement was signed by a root key, it MUST include log. log
   maps to an array of JSON objects with the following claims.  The
   semantics of these fields are defined in [RFC6962] for v1 and
   [RFC9162] for v2.

     +---------+----------+--------------------+---------------------+

                                  Table 5

   We say that an endorsement _endorses_ a token if its key claim equals
   the token's verification key, and its sub claim equals the token's
   iss claim.  We note that the latter includes the possibility of both
   sub and iss being undefined.

   We say that an emblem is _valid_ with respect to an endorsement if
   all the following conditions apply:

   *  The endorsement's emb.prp claim is undefined or a superset of the
      emblem's emb.prp claim.

   *  The endorsement's emb.dst claim is undefined or a superset of the
      emblem's emb.dst claim.

   *  The endorsement's emb.bearers claim is undefined or for each BI
      within the emblem's emb.bearers claim, there exists an BI within
      the endorsement's emb.bearers claim which is more general than the
      emblem's emb.bearers claim.

   *  The endorsement's emb.wnd claim is undefined or the sum of
      emblem's nbf and the endorsement's emb.wnd claims is greater than
      or equal to the emblem's exp claim.

4.  Public Key Commitment

   Parties must undeniably link their root public keys to their OI.  In
   this section, we specify the configuration of a emblem issuer's OI.
   Root public keys are all public keys which are only endorsed by third
   parties and never endorsed by the organization itself.  A party MAY
   have multiple root public keys.

   Any root public key MUST be encoded as JWK as per [RFC7517] and
   [RFC7518].  Root public keys MUST include the alg and kid parameters,
   and the kid parameter MUST be the key's JWK Thumbprint as per
   [RFC7638], encoded in Base 32 as per [RFC4648].

   For a root public key to be configured correctly, there MUST be an
   X.509 certificate that:

   *  MUST NOT be revoked

   *  MUST be logged in the Certificate Transparency logs [RFC6962],
      [RFC9162]

      -  Note that log inclusion requires a valid certificate chain that
         leads to one of the logs accepted root certificates.  Clients
         are RECOMMENDED to verify that this chain is valid and that
         none of the certificates along it have been revoked.

   *  MUST be valid for at least all the following domains (<OI> is
      understood to be a placeholder for the party's OI):

      -  adem-configuration.<OI>

      -  For root public key's kid <KID> (to be understood as a
         placeholder): <KID>.adem-configuration.<OI>

   We intentionally do not specify how clients should check a
   certificate's revocation status.  It is RECOMMENDED that clients use
   offline revocation checks that are provided by major browser vendors,
   for example, OneCRL or CRLite by Mozilla
   (https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Checking_in_Firefox), or
   CRLSet by Chrome (https://chromium.googlesource.com/playground/
   chromium-org-site/+/refs/heads/main/Home/chromium-security/
   crlsets.md).

5.  Signs of Protection

   A sign of protection is an emblem, accompanied by one or more
   endorsements.  Whenever a token includes OIs (in iss or sub claims),
   these OIs must be configured accordingly.  An OI serves to identify
   an emblem issuer or authority in the real world.  Hence, parties MUST
   configure the website hosted under their OI to provide sufficient
   identifying information.

5.1.  Verification

   Whenever a validator receives an emblem, they MAY check if it is
   valid.  The validity of an emblem is defined with respect to a public
   key.  A validity checking algorithm MUST returns the following
   values.  The order of these values encodes the _strength_ of the
   verification result.

   1.  UNSIGNED

   2.  INVALID

   3.  SIGNED-UNTRUSTED

   4.  SIGNED-TRUSTED

   5.  ORGANIZATIONAL-UNTRUSTED

   6.  ORGANIZATIONAL-TRUSTED

   7.  ENDORSED-UNTRUSTED

   8.  ENDORSED-TRUSTED

   Given an input public key and an emblem with a set of endorsements, a
   verification algorithm takes the following steps:

   1.  If the emblem does not bear a signature, return UNSIGNED.

   2.  Run the _signed emblem verification procedure_ (Section 6.1;
       results in one of SIGNED-TRUSTED, SIGNED-UNTRUSTED, or INVALID).

   3.  If previous procedure resulted in INVALID or the emblem does not
       include the iss claim, return the last verification procedure's
       result and the emtpy set of OIs.

   4.  Run the _organizational emblem verification procedure_
       (Section 6.2; results in one of ORGANIZATIONAL-TRUSTED,
       ORGANIZATIONAL-UNTRUSTED, INVALID).

   5.  If the previous procedure resulted in INVALID return INVALID and
       the empty set of OIs.

   6.  If all tokens include the same iss claim, return the strongest
       return value matching *-TRUSTED, the strongest return value
       matching *-UNTRUSTED provided that it is strictly stronger than
       the strongest return value matching *-TRUSTED, and the empty set
       of OIs.

   7.  Run the _endorsed emblem verification procedure_ (Section 6.3;
       results in a set of OIs and one of ENDORSED-TRUSTED, ENDORSED-
       UNTRUSTED, INVALID).

   8.  If the previous procedure resulted in INVALID return INVALID and
       the empty set of OIs.

   9.  Return the strongest return value matching *-TRUSTED, the
       strongest return value matching *-UNTRUSTED provided that it is
       strictly stronger than the strongest return value matching
       *-TRUSTED, and the set of OIs returned by the endorsed emblem
       verification procedure.

   Note that the endorsed emblem verification procedure resulting in
   INVALID is handled implicitly in step 8.  As the procedure did not
   terminate in step 5, organizational verification must have been
   successful.  Hence, INVALID cannot be the strongest return value, and
   an emblem not being accompanied by valid endorsements are downgraded
   to organizational emblems.

   The set of OIs returned by the verification procedure encodes the OIs
   of endorsing parties where verification passed.

5.1.1.  Comments on Trust Policies

   We strongly RECOMMEND against accepting emblems resulting in SIGNED-
   UNTRUSTED.  In such cases, validators should aim to authenticate the
   respective public keys via other, out-of-band methods.  This
   effectively lifts the result to SIGNED-TRUSTED.  Signed emblems are
   supported for cases of emergency where an emblem issuer is able to
   communicate one or more public key, but might not be able to set up a
   signing infrastructure linking their bearers to a root key.

   There is no definite guideline on how to choose which keys to trust,
   i.e., which keys to pass as trusted public key to the verification
   procedure.  Some validators may have pre-existing trust relationships
   with some authorities, e.g., military units of a nation state could
   use the public keys of their nation state or allies.  Other
   validators might be fine with fetching public keys authenticated only
   by the web PKI.

5.2.  Protection

   An emblem for which the verification procedure produces a result
   other than INVALID marks any asset whose address is identified by at
   least one of the emblem's BIs.  Such an emblem signals that the
   respective asset is enjoys the specific protections of IHL.

   Emblem issuers MUST only issue emblems for assets that are used only
   for protected purposes.

6.  Algorithms

6.1.  Signed Emblem Verification Procedure

   Context:

   *  Input: An emblem, a set of endorsements, and a trusted public key.

   *  Output: SIGNED-TRUSTED, SIGNED-UNTRUSTED, or INVALID.

   Algorithm:

   1.  Ignore all endorsements including an iss claim different to the
       emblem's iss claim.  A defined iss claim is understood to be
       different to an undefined iss claim.

   2.  Verify every signature.

   3.  Verify that all endorsements form a consecutive chain where there
       is a unique root endorsement and the public key which verifies
       the emblem is transitively endorsed by that root endorsement.

   4.  Verify that no endorsement expired.

   5.  Verify that all endorsements bear the claim end=true except for
       the emblem signing key's endorsement.

   6.  Verify that the emblem is valid with regard to every endorsement.

   7.  If any of the aforementioned verification steps fail, return
       INVALID.  If there is a token signed by the trusted input public
       key, return SIGNED-TRUSTED.  Otherwise, return SIGNED-UNTRUSTED.

   Distribution methods MAY indicate an order of tokens to guide clients
   assembling the chain of endorsements in step 3.  Whenever such an
   order is specified, clients MAY immediately reject a set of tokens as
   invalid if the indicated order does not yield a valid chain of
   endorsements.

6.2.  Organizational Emblem Verification Procedure

   Context:

   *  Assumptions: Signed emblem verification has been performed and did
      not return INVALID.  Every token as part of the input includes the
      iss claim.

   *  Input: An emblem, a set of endorsements, and a trusted public key.

   *  Output: ORGANIZATIONAL-TRUSTED, ORGANIZATIONAL-UNTRUSTED, or
      INVALID.

   Algorithm:

   1.  Ignore all endorsements including an iss claim different to the
       emblem's iss claim.

   2.  Verify that the top-most endorsement's iss claim value (its OI)
       is configured correctly as specified in Section 4.

   3.  If the aforementioned verification step fails, return INVALID.
       If the top-most endorsing key is equal to the trusted input
       public key, return ORGANIZATIONAL-TRUSTED.  Otherwise, return
       ORGANIZATIONAL-UNTRUSTED.

6.3.  Endorsed Emblem Verification Procedure

   Context:

   *  Assumptions: Organizational emblem verification has been performed
      and did not return INVALID.  There are emblems as part of the
      input including an iss claim different to the emblem's iss claim.

   *  Input: An emblem, a set of endorsements, and a trusted public key.

   *  Output: ENDORSED-TRUSTED, ENDORSED-UNTRUSTED, or INVALID, and a
      set of OIs.

   Algorithm:

   1.  Ignore all endorsements including an iss claim equal to the
       emblem's iss claim.

   2.  For every endorsement:

       1.  Verify its signature.

       2.  Verify that it endorses the top-most endorsing key with the
           same iss claim as the emblem.

       3.  Verify that it did not expire.

       4.  Verify that it bears the claim end=true.

       5.  Verify that the emblem is valid with regard to this
           endorsement.

       6.  Implementations SHOULD verify that the endorsement's iss
           claim value (its OI) is configured correctly as specified in
           Section 4.

       7.  Should any of the aforementioned verification steps fail,
           ignore this endorsement.

   3.  If there are no endorsements remaining after the last step,
       return INVALID and the empty set of OIs.  If in the set of
       remaining endorsements, there is an endorsement with a
       verification key equal to the trusted input public key, return
       ENDORSED-TRUSTED.  Otherwise, return ENDORSED-UNTRUSTED.  In both
       the latter cases, also return the set of all iss claims of the
       remaining endorsements.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  No Endorsements without iss

   The procedures to verify organizational or endorsed emblems as
   specified in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 assume that the emblem's iss
   claim is defined.  Practically speaking, this implies that parties
   can only go beyond pure public key authentication (where public keys
   need to be authenticated out-of-band) by stating an OI.

   The constraints on well-configured OIs offers two beneficial security
   properties:

   *  Parties cannot equivocate their keys, i.e., they need to commit to
      a consistent set of keys.

   *  Parties cannot deny having used certain root public keys.

   These properties stem from parties needing to include a hash of their
   key in a TLS certificate, and consequently, in certificate
   transparency logs.

7.2.  Token Order

   As specified in Section 6.1, clients MAY reject sets of tokens as
   invalid if the order of tokens as indicated by the sending client
   does not yield a valid chain of endorsements.  This allows an
   adversary to force rejection of a set of tokens by altering, e.g.,
   sequence numbers on non-integrity protected channels such as UDP.

   However, this does not constitute a new attack.  Such adversaries
   could flip a bit in the emblem's signature, rendering the set of
   tokens invalid, too.
